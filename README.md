## 💻 Hi there! I'm Taeyang

I'm an undergraduate student and aspiring AI developer with a strong passion for machine learning, deep learning, and real-world AI applications. Although I haven't had direct industry experience yet, I’ve worked on multiple hands-on projects and continue to study rigorously to build a solid foundation.

My focus areas include natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, multimodal AI, emotion recognition, chatbots, investment analysis, and healthcare. I aim to build a practical and impactful AI portfolio through consistent experimentation and learning.
